	abstract = {The taphonomic study of Petit-Bost, Croix-de-Canard and Cantalouette II, three Palaeolithic sites that were recently discovered near Périgueux and Bergerac (Dordogne, France) in a colluvial context, has enlightened the difficulty of adequately appreciating the relative role of cultural and natural processes in site spatial patterning. Periglacial solifluction was thought to have played a significant role in site formation. Because the nature of the modifications induced by solifluction was still poorly understood, a simulation was made using data of soil movement recorded at La Mortice (French Southern Alps, 3100 m in elevation) in a modern periglacial environment. The results show that, for a knapping location, the first steps of deformation are typified both by a downslope translation of the location center and by an anisotropic diffusion of the artifacts. The knapping spot becomes elongated along the slope, with a dense relic concentration of artifacts in the upslope portion. This type of pattern has been obtained after 100–200 years of simulated displacement according to the climatic and soil conditions that characterise the La Mortice site. The ultimate stages of deformation show that the artifact distribution tends to homogenise on larger surfaces and resemble a random distribution. The ability of the simulated patterns to closely fit those observed in archaeological contexts is evaluated at three sites from Southwestern France. At Petit-Bost, the hypothesis of limited solifluction explains accurately the association of both cultural (artifact concentrations) and natural (artifact preferred orientation) features. At Croix-de-Canard, long-term solifluction can be proposed. By contrast, the simulated patterns do not describe the structures observed on the steeper slopes at Cantalouette II, where the knapping spot transforms into distinct solifluction lobes.},

While many methods exist for constructing and comparing mortality profiles, plotting the percentages of juvenile, prime, and old individuals on a triangular graph, or ternary diagram, remains a popular method for making comparisons. Typically, these comparisons are made visually, but because sample sizes are often small, any differences may be the product of sampling rather than meaningful contrasts in depositional history. To overcome this problem, here we present a likelihood-based method for making statistical comparisons of mortality profiles on a triangular graph, and we make available a cross-platform computer program that implements the method. Although we developed the method with mortality profiles in mind, in principle, it can be used to analyze any kind of artifact for which there are three distinct categories.},

This method allows easy comparisons of multiple samples or multiple species and appears to work even with small sample sizes. However, the utility of triangular graphs is compromised for two reasons: (1) samples cannot be statistically compared and (2) the points on the graph are based on percentages, and, therefore, they do not provide information about sample size. The modified triangular graph described here offers a method for approximating 95\% confidence intervals around the data points by using bootstrapping. Samples with non-overlapping contours are likely to have had different pre- or post-depositional histories. The 95\% density contours reflect sample size since they shrink as samples get larger. Thus, the modified triangular graph allows more confident comparisons of three age class data.},

Archaeological assemblages are characterised by greater isotropy in the fabrics than the sedimentary levels within which they are located, indicating that these differences may be generated by anthropic processes. One of the anthropogenic processes associated with horizontal and vertical displacement of archaeological artefacts is trampling and circulation caused by later occupations. In order to evaluate the effect of movement on materials, we undertook experiments simulating geological and archaeological conditions at Cova Gran. The results show that human trampling does not cause major isotropy in fabrics, but arranges archaeological assemblages towards planar or linear materials according to surface geometry. We were not able to replicate the fabric pattern of materials from the archaeological levels of Cova Gran, suggesting that they must be associated with the activities of human occupation at each level.},

	abstract = {The role of natural processes in the formation of the Bed I and II sites at Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) remains the subject of much debate, five decades after their original excavation. Preferred orientation of items is indicative of water disturbance, but compass bearings were not available in Mary Leakey's (1971) study. Using GIS methods, we have vectorized maps from 1960s excavations at Olduvai, and applied a range of statistical techniques to calculate items strike. The GIS analysis suggests strongly preferred orientation patterns in Bed I, and more heterogeneous angular histograms in Bed II. Two complementary lines of evidence support these results. Firstly, modelling of potential mapping errors provides a large interval of confidence for preferred orientation patterns. Second, the GIS study was extended to photographs of the earlier excavations and to maps from recent fieldwork at Olduvai; both yielded patterned arrangement of lithics and bones, and are consistent with results based on the analysis of the 1960s maps, i.e. a large number of the Bed I and II assemblages are preferentially oriented. These results highlight the potential of GIS applications to the analysis of imagery in Stone Age studies, and bear important implications for the understanding of the role of natural agents in site formation processes at Olduvai.},

To achieve this, diagrams and two- and three-dimensional indices were calculated from the azimuth and dip angle of natural clasts and artefacts. The results indicate that the sedimentary levels were formed mainly by planar fabric shape gravitational processes (low depositional angles), which differ notably from the archaeological fabrics they contain, characterised by a greater degree of isotropy. This difference in the fabrics would reflect human activity and indicates that the archaeological levels both in Cova Gran and Roca dels Bous have not been subject to significant natural modifications, and are preserved in situ.},

	abstract = {The Shi'bat Dihya 1 site in western Yemen, dated by optically stimulated luminescence to 55 ka, provides insight into the Middle Paleolithic peopling of the Arabian Peninsula. The archaeological layer is interstratified within thick, sandy silt floodplain deposits filling a piedmont basin. Luminescence dates, lack of soil development, and gypsum precipitation indicate a high accretion rate of the floodplain during Marine Isotope Stage 3, in connection with a (semi)-arid environment. Rapid overbank sedimentation was likely a result of the remobilization of loess material deposited on the Yemeni Great Escarpment at the periphery of the adjacent Tihama coastal sand desert or of other sources. Fabric and size analyses of the lithic artifacts, together with spatial projections, indicate site modifications by floods. Primary modifications include (1) selective accumulation of medium-sized lithic pieces as a result of hydraulic sorting, (2) bimodal orientation of artifacts, and (3) ripple-like arrangement of lithics and bone/tooth fragments. The overrepresentation of teeth may also be a consequence of sorting. Although floods have distorted the original site patterning, long-distance transport of artifacts by water can be excluded, as indicated by relatively high refitting rate, close proximity of artifacts derived from the same block of raw material, and lack of abrasion of the pieces. Therefore, the site is considered “geologically” in situ because its remobilization by water occurred shortly after human abandonment. This study also stresses that the effective preservation of a site cannot be assessed without careful taphonomic study, even in a potentially favorable depositional context such as silty alluvium.},

	abstract = {Since archaeological sites are often located in or near fluvial environments, a thorough understanding of corresponding formation processes is a critical component of archaeological research. Within this context, we address the following question: how does flake morphology condition transport potential? Specifically, do flakes behave as the idealized spheres often used to characterize geological materials and if so, how might this process modify a debitage assemblage? To address this important issue, we present the results of a fluvial transport experiment designed to evaluate the relationships between flake size, shape, weight, curvature, and transport potential. We begin with an overview of fluvial mechanics and previous archaeological fluvial transport studies and use these studies to design an experiment intended to fill gaps in our knowledge of the relationships between flake morphology and transport potential. Our experimental results suggest that all things being equal, flake weight is the most important variable in both settling velocity and transport distance, although flake shape conditions transport as well. Finally, our study demonstrates the potential structure of fluvially transported assemblages as lag deposits and suggests that fluvially transported assemblages may retain key behavioral information.},

	abstract = {A detailed taphonomic study was undertaken at the Tayara site in order to determine the impact of natural processes such as surface water flow on spatial patterning and site formation. The study focused on Paleoeskimo level II, which contains many lithics and significant faunal remains. Level II integrity was assessed through spatial analysis and by examining the size distribution of lithic artifacts and bone orientation. Experimental knapping aimed at replicating Paleoeskimo lithic technology was used to assess the possible size sorting of lithics. The study indicates that artifact burial by water-laid sediments did not result in a selective impoverishment in small-sized lithics. Statistically significant lithic concentrations and associations suggest that spatial distribution was not significantly modified by site formation processes. However, slight post-depositional changes were presumably induced by water flows in the form of statistically significant horizontal bone reorientations. These occurred when gently flowing water inundated bone accumulations without inducing significant washing or sorting of smaller lithic debris. The spatial integrity evaluation of the level II assemblage reveals a low degree of spatial disturbance and disorganization of the material (i.e., limited entropy), which is likely related to low-energy hydraulic forces and rapid burial soon after Paleoeskimo occupation. The grouping and deposition of much of the occupation debris is likely the result of Paleoeskimo activities (e.g., knapping and butchering), and the lithics and fauna specimens are probably at or very near their original location. These results show the behavioral significance of the grouping and deposition of debris in Tayara's level II. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A Fauresmith assemblage is found at this interface; it is thus crucial to understand the processes of deposition and modification at this poorly understood boundary. The methods used in this study involved the analysis of artifact depositional (dip and orientation) and spatial data, artifact condition, raw materials, and assemblage size profiles. Data presented document the mixing between the lowest levels of the fine sediments and the underlying alluvial gravels. This study thus provides important contextual information for the Fauresmith industry at Canteen Kopje.},

Allochthony and authochthony are frequently assumed from orientation patterns or lack thereof. Although it is still debated to what extent orientation of items can be produced in original depositional contexts, the recent use of GIS tools to measure orientations has highlighted several ways of reproducing A-axes with which to address these taphonomic issues. In the present study, the three most relevant A-axis types are compared to test their accuracy in reproducing water current direction. Although results may be similar in specific bone shapes, differences are important in other shapes. As known in engineering working with wind and fluid mechanics (developing shape optimization), longitudinal symmetrical axes (LSA) are the one that best orient structures against or in the same direction of wind and water. The present work shows that this is also the case for bones (regardless of shape), since LSA produce the most accurate estimates of flow direction. This has important consequences for the interpretation of orientation patterns at sites, since this type of axis is still not properly reproduced by GIS available tools.},

	abstract = {In this study we compare different infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals for dating archaeological deposits. The IRSL and the more recently developed post-IR IRSL (pIR-IR) methods were investigated using polymineral fine grains extracted from the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic western excavation area in the site of La Ferrassie (Dordogne, SW France). The IRSL data measured at 50 °C (IR50) are compared to those obtained with the elevated pIR-IR signals measured for two stimulation temperatures, 225 °C (pIR-IR225) and 290 °C (pIR-IR290). The signals are documented in terms of bleaching and fading rates. In addition, comparisons of the IR50 ages corrected either with the H + L method (Huntley and Lamothe, 2001) or with the dose rate correction method (DRC, Lamothe et al., 2003) are presented. Results show that the polymineral fine grains give a reasonable estimate of the burial age of the samples. The IR50 and pIR-IR225 provide the most reliable ages when they are corrected using the DRC method (because of saturation effects). The polymineral ages are then compared with the previously obtained ages on K-feldspar coarse grains, quartz OSL (Guerin et al., 2015) and radiocarbon ages with the aim of accessing information on the depositional processes. It appears that further comparison of polymineral fine grains to coarse grains is beneficial to evaluate bleaching. Moreover, the polymineral results either confirm or refine the chronology of the La Ferrassie sequence proposed by Guérin et al. (2015), that is, the Mousterian layers range from marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 to the middle of MIS 3. In particular, i) the base of Layer 3 is pushed back to the end of MIS 4 or beginning MIS 3 and ii) the chronological attribution of Layers 4 and 5 is confirmed as MIS 3. Finally, the chronology of the Aurignacian layer (Layer 7) is strengthened by all the feldspars results.},

The analysis is based on modern deposits in active environments. The study shows that fabric characteristics allow discrimination between ‘collective’and individual movement of rock particles. The individual particle movement generally results in a random clast orientation, whereas the processes of ‘collective’movement typically create distinct preferred orientations. The highest fabric strengths together with low values of spherical variance are found in solifluction deposits. A survey of Pleistocene slope deposits indicates, however, that clast fabric has to be used with caution in the identification of past slope dynamics, because significant post-depositional changes may occur during ageing and burial of deposits. The diagnostic significance of fabric characteristics may also be low due to the overlap of the statistical values that typify different processes.},
