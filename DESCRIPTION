Description: Included here are a set of functions for working with orientation data describing the long axis of objects (bearing and plunge). The functions are particularly designed to work with data coming from a total station where a point at each end of the long axis is recorded (a vector); however, the functions more generally work with either vector data or bearing/plunge angles.  Emphasis is placed on statistical testing and on plotting.  Please cite McPherron 2018 in PLOS One when using this code.
